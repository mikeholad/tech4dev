			<h4>120 YEARS OF MAGIC LATERN</h4>
			<p>
				THE people of Ise-Ekiti were stunned on Wednesday, November 30, 1898, when a ‘magic lantern’ was put on exhibition in the town. The villagers, in the present day Ekiti State, could not believe their eyes as they watched the display of the magic lantern.
